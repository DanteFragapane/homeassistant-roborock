Real early stage integration for Roborock vacuums

Thanks for @rovo89 for making this script available https://gist.github.com/rovo89/dff47ed19fca0dfdda77503e66c2b7c7

I've used https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/Home-Assistant-custom-components-Xiaomi-Cloud-Map-Extractor code base for the camera entity. So thanks @PiotrMachowski for it
